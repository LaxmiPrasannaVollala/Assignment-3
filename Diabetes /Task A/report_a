Glucose — Mean and Max Comparison

A random sample of 25 patients was taken from the population of 768.

The mean Glucose level in the sample was slightly lower/higher than the population average. This is expected due to sampling variability — smaller samples tend to fluctuate more from the true population values.

Similarly, the maximum Glucose value in the sample was lower/higher than the population's maximum.

Insight: Small samples might not always capture extreme values or represent the true central tendency. This shows the importance of sample size when estimating population parameters.

The bar charts clearly illustrated this difference, helping us visualize the deviation between sample and population metrics.
